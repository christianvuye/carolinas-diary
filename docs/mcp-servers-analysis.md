# MCP Servers Analysis and Recommendations for Carolina's Diary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and specific recommendations for enhancing AI agent capabilities in the Carolina's Diary project.

## Executive Summary

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to interact with external tools and services through a unified interface. For Carolina's Diary, implementing strategic MCP servers will significantly improve AI agent context awareness, development automation, and overall project maintainability.

## What is MCP?

MCP serves as a standardized communication layer, enabling AI agents like Claude to understand and interact with external APIs, databases, file systems, and development tools. It's often described as "the USB-C port for AI", providing a uniform way to connect LLMs to resources they can use.

### Core MCP Components:
- **Resources**: Data sources that LLMs can access (similar to GET endpoints)
- **Tools**: Actions the AI can perform (similar to POST endpoints)
- **Prompts**: Pre-defined templates for AI interactions

## Current Project Context

**Carolina's Diary** tech stack:
- **Backend**: Python 3.x, FastAPI, SQLite, pytest
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, CSS3
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **Testing**: pytest (backend), React Testing Library (frontend)
