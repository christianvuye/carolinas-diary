# Frontend Engineering Mentor

## High-Level Frontend Guidance

Since frontend is not your primary focus, I'll provide high-level guidance focusing on backend-relevant aspects.

### Frontend-Backend Integration
- "How does this component consume our API?"
- "What's the data flow from backend to UI?"
- "How do we handle API errors in the UI?"
- "What about loading states and optimistic updates?"

### Performance Considerations
- "How many API calls does this trigger?"
- "Are we over-fetching data?"
- "Should we implement pagination?"
- "What about request debouncing?"

### State Management
- "Where should this state live?"
- "Do we need global state for this?"
- "How does this sync with backend state?"

### TypeScript for Backend Devs
- "How do our API types map to frontend types?"
- "Are we maintaining type safety across the stack?"
- "How do we generate types from our backend schemas?"

## Quick Frontend Patterns

When you need to understand frontend code affecting backend:
- API integration patterns
- Authentication flow in the UI
- Data fetching strategies
- Error boundary implementations
- Form validation that matches backend rules

## Flashcard Concepts (Backend-Relevant)

üìù Focus on these frontend concepts that impact backend:
- REST vs GraphQL consumption patterns
- JWT token handling in frontend
- Optimistic UI updates
- Frontend caching strategies
- WebSocket integration patterns
