# Journal App Multi-User Testing Checklist

## Testing Plan with Your Girlfriend

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality (Day 1)
- [ ] **Both create accounts** using different emails
- [ ] **Each person journals separately** for same date
- [ ] **Verify data isolation**: Person A cannot see Person B's entries
- [ ] **Test login/logout** and data persistence

### Phase 2: Edge Cases (Day 2)
- [ ] **Simultaneous usage**: Both journaling at same time
- [ ] **Session management**: What happens when token expires
- [ ] **Data migration**: Are Carolina's existing entries properly assigned
- [ ] **Mobile browser testing**: Auth flow on phones

### Phase 3: User Experience (Day 3-4)
- [ ] **Onboarding flow**: Is signup intuitive?
- [ ] **Performance**: Loading times with auth
- [ ] **Error states**: Network issues, login failures
- [ ] **Feature usage**: Do all existing features work with auth?

## Critical Test Scenarios

### Data Isolation Test
- [ ] User A logs in → creates journal entry for today
- [ ] User B logs in → creates journal entry for today
- [ ] User A logs in → should only see their entry
- [ ] User B logs in → should only see their entry

### Security Test
- [ ] Test API without auth token (should return 401 Unauthorized)
```bash
curl -X GET "your-api-url/journal-entries"
# Should return 401 Unauthorized
```

- [ ] Test API with valid token (should work)
```bash
curl -X GET "your-api-url/journal-entries" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer [token]"
```

- [ ] App performance feels good with auth overhead
- [ ] Your girlfriend would actually use this daily

### Red Flags to Fix First ❌
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Any data mixing between users
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Auth flow breaks or confuses users
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Significant performance degradation
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Mobile experience is broken
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Existing journal entries are lost/corrupted

## Next Steps After Successful Testing

- [ ] **Generic branding** (remove "Carolina" references)
- [ ] **Privacy policy** and terms of service
- [ ] **User onboarding flow** improvements
- [ ] **Analytics** setup to track user behavior
- [ ] **Feedback mechanism** for early users
